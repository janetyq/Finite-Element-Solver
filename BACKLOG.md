# Backlog — Finite Element Solver

The living list of still-open work on the solver: correctness, performance, architecture,
and open-ended ideas. This is a genuinely impressive project — a hand-rolled FEM solver
spanning meshing, multiple PDEs, adaptive refinement, and topology optimization is a large
amount of correct, non-trivial numerical code. The notes below are about hardening and
scaling what's already here, not a knock on the design.

## 1. Bugs & Correctness

### 🟠 Boundary conditions are index-based, so they can't survive a remesh
`BoundaryConditions` stores Dirichlet and Neumann data keyed by vertex *index*, but every
remesher renumbers vertices (`RefinementMesh.update_mesh` rebuilds the index map). Carrying
them over would silently relocate them to unrelated nodes, so `check_remeshable` refuses.
A body force already avoids this — `add_force` takes a function of position and re-evaluates
on any mesh; Dirichlet/Neumann need the same treatment (a predicate or region over
coordinates, resolved against whichever mesh is current).

This is the remaining blocker on closed-loop adaptive refinement: `Solver.adaptive_refinement`
now drives the refine → rebuild → re-solve loop correctly and is tested, but it can only run
for force-only problems until this lands. The other half is the error estimator
([§3](#3-open-ended-suggestions--future-ideas)); with both, the `examples/solver_demos.py`
demo can be un-gated.

## 2. Performance & Scaling

### 🟠 Everything is dense — this is the single biggest limiter
`FEMesh.assemble_matrix` (`fem/mesh/femesh.py`) builds `A = np.zeros((dim*N, dim*N))` and
solves via `np.linalg.solve` (`fem/solver.py:solve_linear_system`). FEM matrices are
extremely sparse (each row has a handful of nonzeros), so this is `O(N²)` memory and
`O(N³)` solve time. On the 40×40 meshes in the tests that's fine; it will fall over well
before "interesting" resolutions. Concretely:
- Assemble with `scipy.sparse.lil_matrix`/COO triplets, convert to CSR.
- Solve with `scipy.sparse.linalg.spsolve` (or `cg`/`splu` with caching for the time-stepping
  loops, where the matrix is constant across iterations).

This one change probably unlocks 1–2 orders of magnitude in mesh size, and the MMS
convergence test guards correctness through the migration.

### 🟠 `assemble_everything` runs on every `solve()`
`fem/solver.py:Solver.solve` even flags it: `# TODO: don't call this every time`. For
heat/wave the system matrices are rebuilt implicitly each timestep via re-assembly; for
topology optimization `solve()` is called every iteration. Cache `M`, `M_b`, `K` and only
re-factor when the mesh or material actually changes. For time-stepping, pre-factor
`(M + K·dt)` once (LU) and reuse.

### 🟠 `calculate_smoothing_matrix` is dense `O(n_elem²)`
`fem/numerics.py:calculate_smoothing_matrix` materializes a full element-by-element
distance matrix. For topology optimization at any real resolution this dominates memory. A
spatial hash / KD-tree (`scipy.spatial.cKDTree.query_ball_point`) building a sparse weight
matrix would scale far better and is a near drop-in.

### 🟠 Refinement and meshing are `O(n²)` from linear scans
`fem/mesh/refinement.py` is self-described as "very inefficient": `get_shared_triangle`,
`get_triangle_idx`, and `get_point_idx` each do a full linear scan of all triangles/vertices,
inside refinement loops. `get_point_idx` in particular scans every vertex to dedupe midpoints
— an edge→midpoint-index dict would make it `O(1)`.

### 🟠 `EnergySolver` Hessian is dense and rebuilt each Newton step
`fem/energy_solver.py:energy_hessian` allocates an `(n·dim, n·dim)` dense Hessian every
iteration and solves it densely. Same sparse story as above; here it matters even more
because it's inside a Newton loop.

## 3. Open-Ended Suggestions & Future Ideas

**Numerics**
- 💡 **Higher-order elements.** Already on the roadmap (quadratic basis). The `Element` class
  hierarchy is well-positioned — add `QuadraticTriangleElement` with its own shape functions
  and a real quadrature rule (the `fem/quadrature.py` rules are written but not yet wired into
  assembly).
- 💡 **Proper Gaussian quadrature.** Assembly currently uses closed-form linear-element
  integrals. A general quadrature layer (reference element + Gauss points + Jacobian) would
  make adding new element types and variable coefficients far easier, and is a prerequisite for
  the quadratic elements above. Decide `quadrature.py`'s fate: integrate it or mark it WIP.
- 💡 **Iterative solvers + preconditioning.** Once sparse, add CG with a Jacobi/AMG
  preconditioner for the SPD systems (Poisson, elasticity) — where large 3D problems become
  tractable.
- 💡 **A posteriori error estimator** so adaptive refinement is fully closed-loop — the
  residual scaffolding is already sketched in `fem/solver.py`. `Solver.adaptive_refinement`
  takes the estimator as a callable `(solver) -> per-element error`, so this drops straight in.

**Features**
- 💡 The README's roadmap (thermal expansion, transport, fluid mechanics, nonlinear
  hyperelasticity via the existing `EnergySolver`/`Energies` machinery) all fit the current
  architecture well. Finishing `NeohookeanEnergyDensity` would immediately give a nonlinear
  material through the already-working Newton solver.
- 💡 **N-D elasticity.** `LinearElasticEnergyDensity` and `EnergySolver` now reject non-2D
  input explicitly instead of failing deep inside an einsum, but their tensors are still built
  at fixed rank. Generalizing them over `dim` is the actual feature behind that guard.
- 💡 **Time-integration abstraction.** Backward-Euler (heat) and Crank–Nicolson (wave) are
  hand-coded inline. A small `TimeIntegrator` interface (θ-method / generalized-α) would
  deduplicate and make it trivial to add new dynamics.
- 💡 **Robin BC path** — the README mentions Robin conditions but `BoundaryConditions` only
  models Dirichlet/Neumann explicitly.
- 💡 **Time-varying loads and Dirichlet data.** `self.b` is built once and assumed constant in
  time; `solve_wave` notes where the Crank–Nicolson `b_n`/`b_{n+1}` average collapses because
  of it, and `_wave_block_constraints` assumes Dirichlet values are constant (so `du/dt = 0`
  at fixed nodes).

**Engineering**
- 💡 **Coverage.** Add `pytest-cov`, then fill gaps — `svg`, `generation` (Rupperts/approx
  mesh), the 3D tet path, and adaptive refinement have no *correctness* tests.
- 💡 **Type hints + docstrings on the public API** (`Solver`, `FEMesh`, `BoundaryConditions`,
  `Equation`), plus `pyright`/`mypy` (gradual) — the surface most likely to be used by others
  (or future-you).
- 💡 **pre-commit hooks** (ruff + whitespace) so the CI checks run locally before each commit.
- 💡 **README refresh.** The "Project Structure" section and described capabilities have
  drifted from the code.
- 💡 **Benchmarks.** A tiny script timing assembly + solve vs. mesh size would make the impact
  of the sparse migration concrete and guard against future regressions.
- 💡 **Mesh formats.** `fem/io.py` writes meshes as JSON; `.off`/`.obj` export would make them
  loadable by standard tools.

## Suggested Priority Order

1. **Sparse matrices + solver** (§2) — the highest-leverage single change for capability.
2. **The correctness bugs** (§1) — cheap relative to their blast radius, and they clear the deck.
3. **Coverage + type hints** (§3) — deepen the safety net before the bigger numerics work.
4. **Then the numerics roadmap** — quadrature → higher-order elements → time-integrator →
   adaptive refinement.
